The topic covered terrestrial, aquatic, insectivorus, non-chlorophyll, creepers, climbers, aerial root plants etc. I was showing Insectivorus plants with my group. I made a model of Nepenthes Khaisana, the Pitcher plant found in mineral deficient soil. It was appreciated a lot.

A lot of study-time together, joint efforts for the models and memorising the text to be spoken, all thsi led to our fantastic performance on the final day of science exhbition. Our topic was Insectivorous plants. I was showing Pitcher plant, Reyansh was showing Venus fly-trap, and Aman showed the Sun-dew. It was a fabulous experience working for the project.
